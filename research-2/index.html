        <h2>Source 1: Atmospheric CO2 over the last 1000 years: A high-resolution record from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core</h2>
       
        <p><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GB004247">This article</a> This presents data from ice cores, which contains information on CO2 levels dating back 1000 years. The ice cores come from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Overall, the data shows trends over the years, how in pre-industrial society, there was a trend decrease of CO2 levels. This changed during industrialization, reinforcing that atmospheric CO2 levels have been on the rise since 1850 A.D.. Having access to other long term trend of CO2 allows for constructing a more informed prediction of the future.</p>

        <h2>Source 2: Predicting the loss of forests, carbon stocks and biodiversity driven by a neotropical ‘gold rush’</h2>
       
        <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723004135#:~:text=Our%20model%20predicted%20a%209,reduce%20the%20probability%20of%20deforestation.">This article</a> breaks down the issues contributing to deforestation in other parts of the world, mapping out a trend to 2043. It explains how mining, human activity, and settlements are causing alarming deforestation in tropical forests around the world. The central benefit of this research is that is it establishes a model to predict deforestation. Being able to visualize and have this data is key for creating accurate predictions of the future. As a benefit to the model, researchers were able to accurately predict that taking a more proactive approach would mitigate deforestation, overall reduce the impact of human activity in the area by 17%. This sort of research is key in this region because the forests do so much for the rest of the world too.</p>

        <h2>Source 2: Deforestation and Forest Degradation: The Causes, Effects, and Solutions</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/deforestation-forest-degradation-causes-effects-solutions">This article</a> This article covers the basics of deforestation vs. degradation, both are problems. This is highlighting how ecosystems are being hurt by human activity. This source gives an overall view deforestation, and explains the global significance of forest ecosystems. It explains that the leading causes of deforestation are logging industry, agriculture, wildfires, mining, and infrastructure. These overall will have consequences stemming from deforestation. It leads to a diminished ability for the Earth to capture and store greenhouse gases. It also leads to a loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Deforestation can lead to other climate consequences such as flooding, soil erosion, as well as affecting other ecosystems and communities directly. Another consequence is changing climate patterns. The source gives an overall view but also provides some solutions, it creates a path forward by being speculative.</p>
