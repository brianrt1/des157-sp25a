        <h2>The code behind the planned project needs to be both efficient and effective. I first need to develop a css animation for placing objects on my world. This feature allows for the world to change as time progresses.</h2>
       
        <p>I need to develop a dataset using JSON, so that when the year is changed, the data set determines the spawn rate for new objects. The first object that spawns are trees, starting 1000 years back. For example the spawn rate 1000 years in the past is 100%, the spawn rate for trees 1000 years in the future is 0%.
            At the top is a control, with 3 different arrows to the right and 3 different arrows to the left of a year display. Clicking these will skip ahead in time forwards and backwards, this is what the user uses to navigate the design.</p>

        <p>There will also be some static elements, year-based animations displaying on the world. Adding cars, airplanes, and trains are a good way to signify the year. There will also be satellites in orbit at a certain point.</p>

        <p>The coding behind this projects is time-consuming, but with this planning I’m able to look ahead and break down the project into something more manageable. There’s lots of different objects that will display according to what year the design is currently set at. My goal is with a simple design, create a symbolic representation of the world that shows our impact on land as technology and the needs of people grow and progress.</p>

        <p>
            List of libraries I can leverage:
            <ul>
                <li>GSAP (for animating text easily)</li>
                <li>JQuery (for performing misc. animations on objects, & splash screens)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
