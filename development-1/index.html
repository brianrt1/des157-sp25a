        <h1>Proposal</h1>
        <h2>By Brian Rodriguez-Torres<br>Tue May 6, 2025</h2>
        <p>The Interactive Media III project, "Our Story" portrays the concerns of humanity by mapping out our heritage so far, then offering a glimpse 1000 years into the future. The audience is the next generation, who have to make key decisions that will drastically shape the future. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Using speculative design principles combined with constructing utopian/dystopian narratives, it's possible to offer a prediction of the future based on what where we stand today. This site is designed so that if the world falls to all the pressing issues, this becomes digital record of our experience on Earth.
            If all physical records are destroyed, this serves as an interface to re-connect with our roots. It also looks 1000 years into the future, mapping out fictional but plausible historical events.
            <br>
            <br>
            The interface will make use of picture frames that are displayed as the user scrolls. A JavaScript library can help achieve this.
            <br>
            <br>
            Predicting future events will be difficult, but i'll rely on predictions backed by science and research. I'll include both the obvious potential downfalls and advancements such as automation and space exploration, but also potential disasters.
            <br>
            <br>
            A challenge will be adding interaction, creating a project that can vary based on user decisions and input.
